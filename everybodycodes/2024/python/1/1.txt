--- Part I ---

The green farmlands of Algorithmia are in constant danger from creatures hiding
in the dark. It would be wise to include some fun in the mission, so the first
challenge of the tournament is protecting the important crops from destruction.

Each brave knight is given a specific piece of land to protect, but the job
isn't just about fighting magical creatures. The battle requires using healing
potions, which must be planned ahead of time. The Council of Wizards, who are
always observing and judging, will evaluate competitors based on the use of
healing potions.

The goal is to defeat all enemies while using the fewest number of potions
possible. Therefore, your potion plan must be executed with accuracy and
insight. Luckily, the kingdom's smartest spies have gathered a list of incoming
creatures for each area (your notes). You also know exactly how many potions
are needed for each type of creature:

- Ancient Ant (A): Not very dangerous. Can be managed without using any
  potions.
- Badass Beetle (B): A big and strong bug that requires 1 potion to defeat.
- Creepy Cockroach (C): Fast and aggressive! This creature requires 3 potions
  to defeat it.

With this knowledge, you must order the exact number of potions that need to be
made for your mission. Example based on the following notes:

ABBAC

Each creature is shown by a single letter, leading to this sequence of battles:

- No potions are needed for the first A (Ancient Ant).
- 1 potion is needed for the first B (Badass Beetle).
- 1 potion is needed for the second B (Badass Beetle).
- No potions are needed for the next A (Ancient Ant).
- 3 potions are needed for the last monster, C (Creepy Cockroach).

In total, you need to order: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 5 potions.

--- Part II ---

Round two begins! A new area awaits, bringing with it a new list of foes, and a
familiar but formidable opponent:

- Diabolical Dragonfly (D): A fast and tricky enemy, hard to hit. This creature
  requires 5 potions to defeat it.

This time, however, the battles become more challenging. According to the
kingdom's spies, the enemies sometimes join forces in pairs, making them
tougher to defeat.

When two monsters pair up, you will need one more potion per creature than in a
one-on-one fight. Your list remains a single line of creatures, but now you
must interpret it in pairs. The x symbol shows an empty spot where no monster
appears, so for these pairs your calculations should follow the same rules as
for individual battles.

Example based on the following notes:

AxBCDDCAxD

After splitting into pairs, the battle sequence looks like this:

Ax BC DD CA xD

- The Ax pair requires no potions because a single Ancient Ant remains weak as
  before.
- The BC pair requires 6 potions which is 2 for the Badass Beetle and 4 for the
  Creepy Cockroach because they are attacking together.
- The DD pair requires 12 potions which is 6 per Diabolical Dragonfly instead
  of the usual 5 since they are attacking together.
- The CA pair requires 5 potions which is 4 for the Creepy Cockroach and 1 for
  the Ancient Ant.
- The xD pair requires 5 potions because no additional potion is needed for a
  single Diabolical Dragonfly.

In total, you must order: 0 + 6 + 12 + 5 + 5 = 28 potions.

--- Part III ---

The final round is here, and, as expected, it is the most challenging of all!
Although no new enemies have appeared, they have grown wiser and realized their
strength in numbers.

In this ultimate challenge, you will not just face pairs, but also groups of
three! For these tough battles, you will need 2 extra potions per creature
compared to fighting them one-on-one.

Example based on the following notes:

xBxAAABCDxCC

Once the battles are split into their respective groups, they will unfold as
follows:

xBx AAA BCD xCC

In total, you must order: 1 + 6 + 15 + 8 = 30 potions.
